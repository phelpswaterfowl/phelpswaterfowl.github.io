<h1>About Us</h1>

<figure>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>I am finally getting back to updating my site with the help of my son-in-law. I have gone from the crazy lady dragging 3 little kids to shows to kids getting married and in college. I truly feel the 4-H and poultry experience has benefited all of them.</p>
    <p> We have moved to South Carolina. I have always bred my birds to be cold hardy and now we are going the opposite way. Due to life happening, I have not hatched in 2 years and cut my flock to my top ten birds in each color. I have also cut my colors in calls to white, gray, and butterscotch. We also have chocolate, white, and penciled runners.</p>
    <p>We have a new "state of the art" barn for our birds. My husband has set up a gravity feed of fresh water off of our pond so that they have constant clean running water through the troughs in the outdoor portion of their pens. Feather quality has improved immensely. See more about this gravity-fed system <a href="/photos/barn">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I hope to resume showing at the Ohio National and a few of the southern shows.</p>

<h2>Our Farm Philosophy</h2>

<p>Our goal is to continuously improve the overall quality of the waterfowl that we raise. We accomplish this through our continued selective breeding program that is based on the American Poultry Association's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_of_Perfection">Standards of Perfection</a>, a guide revered by many small animal breeders. We are proud members of the National Call Breeders of America, and The American Poultry Association.  </p>

<h2>Pointers and Hints</h2>

<p>We have learned a lot about duck breeding throughout our over ten years' experience in the breeding of ducks, and one of the things I want to do most is to help others benefit from the things we have learned throughout the years.

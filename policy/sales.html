<h1>Sales Policy</h1>

<h2>Duckings / Eggs</h2>

<p>I will sell pet quality ducklings starting in the spring. No shipping and don’t ask. No fertile egg sales.</p>

<h2>Breeder Birds</h2>

<p>I offer breeder quality adults starting in May of each year. Birds can be delivered to any of the shows that I attend. Pricing depends on quality of birds. All birds must be paid in full prior to delivery. These are birds capable of producing top offspring.</p>

<h2>Show Quality Birds</h2>

<p>Everyone’s definition of show birds is different. I will not sell a bird that is labeled “show quality”. My breeder birds are priced by quality. And depending on the show, they may do very well for you.</p>
